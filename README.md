## About

Optimized Oasis is an open-source Minecraft modpack that primarily functions as a comprehensive enhancement to the base game. Initially developed with a focus on optimization, it has now evolved into a kitchen sink modpack, encompassing a wide variety of modifications.

This modpack is designed with the main aim of enhancing the game's performance and introducing quality of life features, making the gameplay experience smoother and more enjoyable. Despite these modifications, the gameplay remains largely familiar to the vanilla Minecraft experience, with the addition of new features and improvements that do not make the game feel drastically different.

This modpack offers a balance between performance optimization and gameplay enhancement, providing both a smoother experience and a richer, more diverse Minecraft world to explore.

## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Q: Why was the original repository privatized?</summary>
<br>
A: This was done primarily to remove raw mod files, 
among other reasons. However, this task presented difficulties, leading to the decision to recreate the repository instead.
