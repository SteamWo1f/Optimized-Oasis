Heyo, it's been a bit  ~~*(6 Months)*~~, but I'm back and with big news.

*Optimized Oasis has been updated to a new MC version*, This time 1.21.4 is the latest.

And that's not all, Optimized Oasis has switched from Quilt to Fabric as it's chosen loader. 
This is not to say that Quilt is bad in any way. I simply wanted to switch over to a loader with a more stable and active development, along with larger community support. 
Nonetheless, thank you to the Quilt devs for what you have created, and I wish you luck.

Along with that, since we have both updated the version and loader. There have been a lot of additions and removals to Optimized Oasis. The full list is below.
