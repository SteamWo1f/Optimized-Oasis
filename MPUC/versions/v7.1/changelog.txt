Optimized Oasis 7.1

This is just a small patch to the custom menus along with some newly updated mods.

Thanks for playing :]

***Small Post-Release Fixes:***

*1: If the bed texture is reversed, you can try to remove the "g-p" folder in your config folder. This should fix the texture.*

*2: If you are having trouble with resource packs, you can either remove or downgrade [MoreMcmeta](https://modrinth.com/mod/moremcmeta) to version 4.4.7, this should fix this issue.*

*3: If night vision in crashing your game, try removing or disabling [Better Night Vision](https://modrinth.com/mod/betternightvision)*
