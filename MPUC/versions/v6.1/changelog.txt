That's all for the modpack but I also want to say that I did a full color revamp to the [Official Optimized Oasis Website](https://steamwo1f.github.io/OOS/), 
I'm still working on it since mobile support isn't all there yet but I am pretty proud of how it looks at this moment.

Well that's all for today, I hope y'all enjoy this update and have fun exploring the sands.
